Intro: We are building a command shell using c++ that will be able to Print a command prompt, read in a line of command(s) (and connector(s)) from standard input, and execute the appropriate commands using fork(), execvp(), and waitpid()

We will be using the composite design pattern in the development of this project.

Classes:We will have three classes. The first class will be called SRC which will contain all .cc/.cpp files. The third class will be called unit-tests. This class will contain all the unit tests that involve the Google Unit Test framework. 

Prototype and Research: create a small prototype using fork(), waitpid(), and execvp() individually and together

Development and Testing roadmap:
